# Code Quality Check

## Goals

- Make the changed code easy to read, review, debug, and safely modify later.
- Prefer simple structure and clear names over explanatory comments.
- Preserve important design decisions where future maintainers will need the context.
- Avoid comment noise that repeats obvious code behavior.
- Run the smallest meaningful executable checks first, then widen only when needed.
- Keep verification notes concise and reusable for commit summaries, PR bodies, or handoff notes.
- Pair with `skill-quality-check` for Agent Skill changes and `security-check` for security- or
  supply-chain-sensitive paths.

## Workflow

1. Read the changed files and nearby call sites, not just the patch.
2. Identify code that is hard to scan, overly nested, duplicated, misleadingly named, or coupled to
   hidden assumptions.
3. Make safe local readability refactors where practical.
4. Add or update comments only when the design intent is not obvious from the code and cannot be
   made obvious with a small refactor.
5. Remove stale, redundant, and misleading comments.
6. Use `prose-quality-check` for documentation, comments, release notes, PR text, issue text,
   and other explanatory prose that needs readability or wording changes.
7. Re-run the project's language-specific quality checks after edits.
8. Summarize which checks ran, which passed, and why any relevant check was skipped.

When reviewing an abstract scenario or a proposed change without concrete files, produce a review
plan instead of pretending to inspect code. State the assumptions, the readability changes you would
try first, the comments you would keep or add, the text-audience classifications that must be made,
and the checks you would run once real files exist.

Separate missing input from skill ambiguity. If exact files, commands, release metadata, or
provenance are unavailable, report them as assumptions, verification blockers, or target-change
risks. Do not treat them as unclear points in this skill unless the workflow itself fails to say how
to proceed.

## Comment Policy

Use comments to explain **why**, not **what**, unless the code is constrained by an external system
or a non-obvious algorithm.

Good reasons to leave a comment:

- A trade-off was chosen and another reasonable approach was rejected.
- The code works around a platform, API, data, timing, or compatibility constraint.
- The code depends on ordering, lifetime, concurrency, precision, security, or performance behavior
  that is easy to break later.
- A compact algorithm or protocol step would be difficult to infer from names alone.
- A fallback, validation rule, or migration path preserves behavior for older data.

Prefer refactoring instead of commenting when:

- A better variable, function, type, or module name would make the intent clear.
- Extracting a small helper would remove nesting or repeated logic.
- Reordering code, narrowing scope, or simplifying a condition would make the flow obvious.
- The comment would merely restate assignments, branches, or function calls.

When adding a comment:

- Keep it close to the code it explains.
- Keep it short and specific.
- Name the constraint, trade-off, or invariant.
- Make each comment an accurate explanation of the specific item it annotates. Do not use one
  vague or generic comment to justify multiple unrelated lines, files, suppressions, exceptions, or
  generated edits.
- During bulk edits, review comments one by one after generation. Replace templated filler such as
  "required for tests" or "framework compatibility" with the concrete reason for that exact site,
  or remove the comment if no site-specific reason exists.
- When introducing or tightening a comment policy, search the affected scope for existing comments
  of that kind and apply the policy consistently. Do not update only the new examples while leaving
  matching existing comments below the new standard.
- Place comments where they do not break syntax-aware tooling or formatter grouping. If an adjacent
  standalone comment would split an import block, list, mapping, or generated section in a way tools
  rewrite or reject, use a same-line comment or another nearby location that preserves the group.
- Update nearby tests or verification notes if the comment documents behavior that must stay true.

### CI and Configuration Comments

For configuration-as-code, CI workflows, build files, and tool configuration, intent comments are
most useful near non-obvious fixed values: pinned tool versions, runtime images, lockfile paths,
ordering constraints, suppressions, generated-file exclusions, timeout values, matrices, or external
action references.

When commenting on those values:

- Explain the maintenance signal as well as the initial reason: when maintainers should revisit the
  value and what compatibility, reproducibility, security, or operational constraint must stay true.
- Keep broad repeated update policy in one maintained document or shared workflow guidance when
  repeating it beside every value would drift.
- Use local comments for site-specific constraints, exceptions, or links to central policy.
- Avoid comments that merely restate the YAML key, tool option, version literal, or file path.

## Developer-Facing Language

Treat developer-facing text separately from user-facing text. This includes comments, log messages,
exception messages, diagnostics, and internal assertions.

Use English for developer-facing text regardless of the application's user-facing language.

When the audience is unclear, classify whether the text is developer-facing, user-facing, or part of
an external contract before changing it.

## User-Facing Language

Treat user-facing text separately from developer-facing text. This includes UI copy, CLI output,
validation messages, accessibility text, and external API text shown to users or consumed by
integrations.

Follow the application's product copy, localization, accessibility, CLI output, and external API
contract rules for user-facing text.

Do not change user-facing text to English only to satisfy the developer-facing language policy. If a
message can be both user-facing and developer-facing, classify its audience and contract first, then
update tests, snapshots, docs, or changelog entries that intentionally cover that surface.

## Design Decision Checklist

Before finishing, check whether the change includes any design decision that future maintainers
would not recover from the code alone:

- Why this boundary, abstraction, data shape, or lifecycle was chosen.
- Why a simpler-looking alternative is unsafe or intentionally avoided.
- Why behavior differs across platforms, versions, modes, providers, or file formats.
- Why an error is swallowed, retried, delayed, cached, normalized, or surfaced.
- Why a broad dependency, global state, mutable state, or escape hatch is acceptable here.

If the decision still matters after the code is cleaned up, record it with a concise comment near
the relevant code. If the decision affects public behavior, configuration, operations, or release
notes, also update the appropriate docs or changelog.

## Verification Discipline

- Start with the narrowest check that exercises the changed behavior, then run the broader
  language-, framework-, or tool-specific checks expected by the project.
- If a check fails, fix the narrow cause and rerun that same check before widening scope.
- Do not skip executable checks only because dependencies or tools are not installed yet; install or
  provision them using the project's documented workflow when that is safe and reproducible.
- If verification is still impossible after setup, state the concrete blocker and the command that
  could not run.
- Keep verification consistent across local fixes, commits, and review or handoff preparation.
- Record skipped checks with a concrete reason, not a generic "not run" note.

## Supply-Chain Baseline

Use `security-check` as the canonical security and supply-chain reference when a change
introduces or updates external executable artifacts, dependency provenance, package-runner
invocations, downloaded CLI tools, CI actions, containers, vendored files, generated code from
external tools, copied files, or lockfile entries.

At minimum:

- Treat those paths as supply-chain-sensitive.
- Require the repository's cooldown, pinning, provenance, and runtime-behavior checks before
  adoption.
- Report a blocker or documented maintainer exception when release age, provenance, runtime
  behavior, or cooldown compliance cannot be verified.
- For copied, generated, vendored, or downloaded files, record the source, version or commit, and
  validation method when relevant.

## Output Checklist

- Readability issues were either fixed or deliberately left with a reason.
- Important design intent is captured near the code, docs, or PR notes.
- Comments explain non-obvious intent and do not repeat obvious code behavior.
- Stale or misleading comments were removed.
- Language-specific formatting, linting, typing, and tests were run or any skipped check has a
  concrete reason.
- Missing files, commands, metadata, or provenance were reported as assumptions, target-change
  risks, or verification blockers rather than as findings invented from unavailable evidence.
- Agent Skill changes were checked with `skill-quality-check` when applicable.
- Security-sensitive behavior and supply-chain-sensitive artifacts were checked with
  `security-check` when applicable.
- If no concrete code was available, the output clearly says that this was a review plan and lists
  the assumptions instead of presenting file-specific findings.
