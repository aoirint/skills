  Create and maintain canonical developer release changelogs. Use when adding
  developer-facing release history, maintaining Keep a Changelog sections, or
  preparing canonical version entries; not for user-facing release-note writing
  or publishing.

# Changelog Workflow

## When to Use

- Use this skill when updating the canonical developer changelog.
- Use this skill when preparing canonical versioned release history before a
  release.
- Use this skill when preserving developer-facing prerelease, compatibility,
  migration, CI/build/package, or implementation context.

## Goals

- Keep the confirmed canonical changelog, often `CHANGELOG.md`, as the
  Keep a Changelog-style release history.
- Record notable changes for maintainers in a human-readable, newest-first
  format.
- Preserve prerelease and internal context in the canonical changelog even when
  it will not appear in user-facing release notes.
- Preserve enough rationale and history for user-facing release notes to explain
  why each user-visible change matters.
- Keep user-facing release-note rewriting and release-readiness checks in the
  dedicated release-note workflow.

Reference:

- Keep a Changelog 1.1.0: http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/

## Workflow

1. Update the canonical changelog first when a release-history change is
   needed. If the file is not clearly `CHANGELOG.md`, locate or confirm the
   canonical changelog before editing.
2. Keep `Unreleased` at the top.
3. Move `Unreleased` entries into a versioned section only when the maintainer
   has selected the release version and UTC release date.
   - Do not create placeholder version headings with `TBD`,
     `<maintainer-selected date>`, or similar unfinished release metadata.
     Keep draft material under `Unreleased` until the version and date are
     known.
4. Use Keep a Changelog categories when applicable: `Added`, `Changed`,
   `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, and `Security`.
   - Put supplemental release metadata that is not itself a change type, such as
     compatibility notes and test environments, under `Notes` instead of making
     separate top-level change-category headings.
   - Put `Notes` after all change-category sections within each release entry.
5. Keep versioned sections newest first, with headings such as
   `## v1.2.3 - 2026-05-03 UTC`.
6. Record developer-facing details that help future maintainers, including:
   - Internal migrations or architecture changes.
   - CI, build, packaging, or dependency context.
   - Security-sensitive or supply-chain-sensitive context from `security-check`, such as
     maintainer-approved exceptions, residual risk, or blockers that matter for future releases.
   - Prerelease entries and why they matter.
   - User-impact rationale or history for each user-visible change, such as
     the problem it solves, why behavior changed, compatibility constraints, or
     migration reason.
   - A sourced user impact statement may be enough when it explains why users
     should care. Generic bullets such as documentation updates, dependency
     updates, crash fixes, or save-format changes still need source material
     describing the user-facing benefit, risk, security impact, compatibility
     impact, or migration reason.
   - Compatibility notes, test environments, known limitations, yanked
     releases, and migration constraints.
   - Record compatibility, support, environment, and migration claims only when
     they are maintainer-confirmed or clearly sourced. Otherwise list them as
     missing inputs or draft source material needing confirmation, not as final
     compatibility facts.
   - When compatibility notes cover several platform, runtime, dependency, or
     companion-product versions, preserve confidence differences instead of
     flattening them into one generic compatibility statement. For example,
     distinguish confirmed compatibility, "appears to work" best-effort
     compatibility, lower-confidence limited checks, and known issues.
   - Keep related compatibility claims grouped by relationship. Put companion
     tools, required plugins, or paired dependencies under the product/version
     they were tested with when that relationship matters, instead of listing
     them as another peer product version.
   - When historical entries are backfilled with metadata such as
     compatibility information, state that the metadata was backfilled, when it
     was backfilled, and whether it is reference information rather than an
     original release claim.
   - For yanked releases, explicitly say when historical metadata was not
     backfilled because the release was yanked, if nearby releases did receive
     backfilled metadata.
7. When prerelease entries are later superseded, keep enough canonical history
   to explain what changed and what reached the stable release. If the stable
   release is still only planned, leave the stable roll-up material under
   `Unreleased` instead of creating an unfinished stable heading.
   - Attach withdrawn or superseded notes to the specific entry they affect,
     rather than only adding a broad later correction. Name the later version
     or release timing that withdrew or superseded the earlier wording.
   - Avoid shorthand prerelease references such as `alpha.1` or `beta.2` when
     the base version matters. Use the full prerelease version, such as
     `v1.2.0-alpha.1`, in durable changelog text.
   - Split long bullets into concise parent items with indented subitems when a
     change contains several facts, reasons, affected versions, or follow-up
     notes.
   - Use `document-quality-check` when splitting or rewording changelog prose.
     Preserve changelog-specific nuance such as compatibility confidence,
     dependency relationships, and whether a statement is original, backfilled,
     inferred, superseded, or withdrawn.
   - Keep the detailed prerelease entry as its own historical record. The
     stable entry should summarize stable promotion, packaging, and durable
     user impact instead of copying prerelease implementation detail wholesale.
8. For compatibility labels and other package metadata, distinguish repository
   history from public package history before choosing changelog wording.
   - Check what the target publication channel's existing packages actually
     exposed to users; local metadata, documentation, and GitHub-only
     prereleases are not substitutes for that history.
   - When a stable package introduces a label that no earlier public package
     exposed, record it as added package metadata under `Changed`, even if it
     replaces temporary repository or prerelease wording.
     Do not place that bullet under `Added`: the package metadata changed, but
     the label is not a new product capability. For example:
     `### Changed` followed by `- Added the v100 compatibility label to the
     package.`
   - Use `Fixed` only when correcting metadata or behavior that was already
     exposed in a public package. Keep temporary or prerelease-only correction
     context in the canonical history, not in user-facing wording.
   - Avoid Issue and pull-request identifiers in changelog bullets by default.
     Use durable factual wording; include an identifier only when the
     maintainer explicitly needs the link as historical context.
9. If the user asks for user-facing release notes, verify or prepare only the
   canonical source material here, then use the appropriate release-note
   workflow for the user-facing rewrite and release-readiness checks.
   - Update the canonical changelog only when the source material is missing,
     stale, or needs maintainer-facing correction.
   - Treat missing rationale or history for a user-visible change as missing
     canonical source material; add or request it before user-facing rewriting.
   - If the canonical changelog already contains enough source material, stop
     there and hand off user-facing rewriting and readiness checks.
   - Identify the release-note workflow by name when it exists; otherwise
     discover the relevant release-note guidance before producing user-facing
     notes.
   - If confirmed version, UTC release date, target audience, publication
     channel, or release-note workflow are missing, state those as input gaps
     and stop after canonical source preparation.

## Boundaries

- This skill owns the canonical developer changelog; it does not own generated
  or user-facing release-note files.
- Do not publish, tag, create releases, upload artifacts, or edit release
  metadata unless another workflow and explicit user request call for those
  side effects.
- Keep private workspace paths, temporary worktree names, command transcripts,
  and authentication details out of public changelog text.
